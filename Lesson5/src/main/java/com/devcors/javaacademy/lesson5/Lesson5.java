 * <strong>Homework 5</strong>
 * Finalize implementation so that this will become a spring boot application.
 * <p>Fill all necessary code so that beans are properly injected and configuration is loaded.
 * <p>To test your implementation, you can use Lesson5Test,
 * which starts application as a spring boot application and attempts to call methods of {@link OutputFacade}.
 * <p>This application should also be startable as a Spring boot application.
 * <p>Note: do not change implementation of existing methods except for this class {@link Lesson5}.
 * <p>And remember - google is your friend :)
